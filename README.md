# Fraud Detection Model using Ensemble Models with a Focus on Explainability

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Fraud Detection Model using Ensemble Models, with a particular emphasis on Explainability. The goal is to build a robust model that effectively detects fraudulent activities while providing clear insights into the decision-making process for better interpretability.

## Data Source

The dataset for this project was sourced from [Transaction Guard Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nithinreddy90/transactionguarddataset). Special thanks to the data contributor for making this dataset available for analysis and model development.

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing

- Explored the dataset to understand its structure, features, and distribution.
- Checked for missing values, outliers
- EDA via visualizations 
- Data preprocesssing and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Ensemble Model Selection
- Trained the model on Random forest classifier and Xgbclassifier.

  ## Model Selection

For this Fraud Detection project, we opted to use Ensemble Models, specifically a Random Forest Classifier. The decision to choose this model is based on its proven effectiveness in handling complex datasets and providing robust results. Ensemble models combine multiple base models to enhance predictive performance and mitigate overfitting.

### Random Forest Classifier

- **Number of Estimators (Trees):** 100
- **Maximum Depth of Trees:** 10
- **Random State:** 42
- **Number of Jobs:** -1

I chose the Random Forest Classifier for its ability to handle feature importance effectively and provide insights into the decision-making process. Additionally, the model's ensemble nature often results in improved generalization and accuracy, which is crucial for fraud detection tasks.

## Model Evaluation
Evaluated the performance of each model using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score on the test set.

## Model Interpretability with SHAP
Incorporated SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain the predictions of the Ensemble Models.

# Conclusion

The Fraud Detection Model using Ensemble Models has been successfully implemented, providing a robust solution for identifying potentially fraudulent transactions. Throughout the project, several key steps were undertaken to ensure the model's effectiveness, transparency, and interpretability.

### Data Preprocessing

The journey began with the acquisition of the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nithinreddy90/transactionguarddataset), which served as the foundation for analysis. Extensive data preprocessing was performed to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure the dataset's overall quality. Feature scaling and encoding were applied to standardize the input variables and make them suitable for model training.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA played a crucial role in understanding the characteristics of the dataset. Visualization techniques were employed to identify patterns, correlations, and potential insights. This phase helped in making informed decisions about feature engineering and model selection.

### Model Selection

Ensemble Models, particularly the Random Forest Classifier, were chosen for their ability to handle complex datasets and provide reliable predictions. The Random Forest Classifier, with 100 estimators, a maximum tree depth of 10, and a random state of 42, demonstrated superior performance in detecting fraudulent activities.

### Feature Importance

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) library was utilized to interpret the model's predictions and understand feature importance. The summary plot generated using SHAP values provided valuable insights into the contribution of each feature to the model's decisions.

### Model Evaluation

The model's performance was evaluated using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Cross-validation techniques were employed to ensure the model's generalization to unseen data. The results indicated a high level of accuracy in identifying fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

### Explainability

A significant focus of this project was on model explainability. The SHAP values aided in understanding the features' impact but also communicated the model's decisions. This transparency is crucial for building trust in the model and its outputs.

In conclusion, the Fraud Detection Model stands as a reliable tool in identifying and preventing fraudulent transactions. Its interpretability and robust performance make it a valuable asset in safeguarding financial systems against potential threats.
